= RealWorld App in FeathersJS

Run:

....
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cirosantilli/feathers-realworld-example-app
cd react-redux-realworld-example-app
npm install
cd ..
npm install
npm start
....

Forked from https://github.com/randyscotsmithey/feathers-realworld-example-app adding:

* a more direct integration with https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app[]:
** `npm start` starts both front and backend properly linked without any further configuration
** clearer deployment instructions on how to extract the final built static components
** later on might add as well:
*** SSR
*** realtime functionality
* port from MongoDB to sequelize because:
** MongoDB has serious licencing burden, and was removed from several convenient distros
** sequelize runs on SQLite locally and on a real database remotelly, which dispenses the need for local server management which is a pain
